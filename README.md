> <sup>*Abstract* – In an increasingly automated world - from warehouse robots to self-driving cars - streamlining the development and deployment process and operations of robotic applications becomes ever more important. Automated DevOps processes and microservice-based architectures have already proven successful in other domains such as large-scale customer-oriented web services (e.g., Netflix). We recommend to employ a similar microservice-based service-oriented architecture for the deployment of small- to large-scale robotic applications in order to accelerate development cycles, loosen functional dependence, and improve resiliency and elasticity. In order to facilitate involved DevOps processes, we present and release a tooling suite for automating the microservice-based development and build of robotic applications based on the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our tooling suite covers the automated minimal containerization of ROS applications, a collection of useful machine learning-enabled base container images, as well as a handy CLI tool for simplified interaction with container images during the development phase. Within the scope of this paper, we embed our tooling suite into the overall context of streamlined robotics deployment and compare it to alternative solutions.</sup>
